## **Overview**

StreetTMR aims to level the playing field for independent artists by not just allowing them to earn from their fans, but alongside them. We've taken the traditional concept of street teams and evolved it into a digital, monetized platform where fans can earn commissions for promoting their favorite artists.

## **Features**

### **For Artists**

- **Multiple Subscription Tiers**: Choose from our Free, Hometown Hero, Rising Star, or Enterprise packages.
- **Customizable Profiles**: Get a unique subdomain or forward your own domain to a customizable social media-like news board.
- **Monetize Your Music**: Set commissions for your fans, and both of you earn when they promote and sell your music.

### **For Fans**

- **Earn While You Promote**: Sign up, promote your favorite artists, and earn commissions.
- **Exclusive Rewards**: Unlock exclusive content and rewards based on your promotion levels.
- **Personalized Promotion Tools**: Get a custom subdirectory and QR code business cards to help with your promotions.
